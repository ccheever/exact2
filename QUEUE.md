# Queue

What would make sense to do next, in rough order. This is not a spec and decides
nothing: `rules/RULES.md` §Scope says a spec without an implementer and a date isn't
written, so a line here is one to three lines — the thing, why, what it needs. When
someone picks one up it becomes an LLP with a name and a date (the working set is at
15 of 15, so a link gets archived); when it lands, delete the line. Anyone, agents
included, may add or remove a line. `rules/NOT-DOING.md` still binds: an entry that
sits on that list carries the trade it would take.

## Next, in order (2026-08-29)

1. **Land scrolling** (LLP 1010). Staged; the five checks are green on the staged
   tree; the review round's artifacts (`llp/reviews/1010-scrolling-v1.*`) are in
   flight in another session.
2. **Image.** The first replaced element: intrinsic size arrives after decode, the
   kernel relays out, CSS auto aspect ratio when one dimension is given, `object_fit`
   on paint (the row exists; no host lowers it). Web first with `<img>` as the sizing
   oracle, then macOS (`image` nodes draw as boxes today, LLP 1008 §7). Decide where
   bytes come from: URL, bundled asset, or a resource baked into the plan. Builds the
   async-measure → relayout path that Linux text needs anyway.
3. **Agent API follow-ups** (LLP 1012 landed 2026-08-29; `scripts/agent.mjs`,
   `scripts/smoke.mjs`). Not yet: the
   macOS app takes focus while a script runs (`.accessory` + no `activate` would
   not); `screenshot` on macOS misses Metal layers unless `window` is asked for.
   Two things the first screenshots showed (2026-08-29): `tap scheme-dark` journals
   `command setScheme("dark")` and changes nothing — neither host executes the
   runner's commands (`take_commands` has no reader); and at 420 wide the departure
   rows wrap on macOS ("Limited to San Francisco" → two lines) and on Linux (DejaVu
   Sans; root 3244 tall there, 3246 on macOS) but not on the web — `layout` on all
   three would quantify the text-measurement gap.
4. **Dev loop: every host live from one edit.** Not Vite — there is nothing to bundle
   (no app JS by rule, 180 lines of glue, no npm deps). What is missing: a Rust-source
   watch that rebuilds the wasm and pushes a reload, and the same plan push into a
   running macOS app (`build.mjs --run` per iteration today). Charlie to confirm the
   shape.
5. **Linux host follow-ups** (LLP 1015 landed 2026-08-29; r2 the same day: vello on
   the GPU is the main painter, tiny-skia the fallback and pixel oracle; green on
   `expo-build-1000` (CPU), the minisforum (Vulkan/llvmpipe), and headless on macOS
   (Metal)). The DRM path ran on the minisforum 2026-08-29 (LLP 1015 §6: 1920×1080 @ 60 Hz on
   RADV, boot to first flip ~160 ms), seen and driven over the host's own VNC server
   (`EXACT_VNC=1`) since the KVM was unplugged; evdev itself has still carried no real
   event. Owed, in order: **a KMS surface for the GPU**
   (`VK_KHR_display`) so the frame is presented, not read back (17–19 ms of latency
   per frame on Metal today); `canvas` on this painter's device; the Chrome
   comparison of a pixel fixture (the font is pinned since 2026-08-29 — LLP 1015
   §3 — and `smoke linux` is green on a Mac and on the builder); a font cache when a machine's scan (25 ms
   for 787 faces on a Mac) matters; lifting the shared ~120 lines of orchestration
   out of `host/apple` and `host/linux`; one wgpu when vello moves to 30.
6. **Events beyond `click` and `input`** — hover, keyboard, pointer, focus, on both
   hosts (`glue.js` has two listeners). Gate for selection, gestures (`hold`/`observe`
   reach no page event, LLP 1007 §9), and any real app.
7. **Text selection.** Free on the web (nothing sets `user-select: none`); none on
   macOS (CoreText paints per node, LLP 1008 §7). The hard part is cross-node
   selection, the browser's document model. Host state, like scroll offset, never plan
   state. `Paragraph` keeps its `CTLine`s, so hit-to-index is available. After 6.
8. **View transitions** (LLP 1013, Draft RFC). Shared elements, heroes, and magic-move
   the web's way, not RN's: a `view_transition_name` row, an action keyword as the
   boundary, `startViewTransition` on the web, snapshot + host-owned ghost under
   `exact-motion` on macOS, one parity fixture. Identity is by name at the host, so
   `when`/`match` arms keep destroying and creating and nothing reparents in the plan
   model. Needs the agent API's `clock` (3) to seek the ghost, `transition` in the tag
   table (below), and two ghost-only size properties on the engine. Charlie to confirm
   the boundary (§Open questions).

## Cheap, any time

- **Canvas children** → LLP 1014 (RFC, Accepted) — built 2026-08-29, LLP 1014.000
  transcribes it: kernel, corpus, the web wrapper, the macOS overlay and capture with
  D4's four sources, the smoke's steps 6a, 9, and 10 with the readback fixture (native:
  `caltrain-gpu` `tests/children.rs`; per host: `scripts/fixtures/canvas-sky.*.png`,
  cross-host mean 1.48/255 as measured — a first number for 1009 §4.1); the line map's
  stations as children (the second use); the render tail measured and closed (0.5 ms
  steady; occluded windows now skip rendering); Accepted 2026-08-29, the §5 take applied
  (the three gradient rows are out — 1009's proposal for the same door). 2026-08-30:
  the app inside the sky (glass/ink/crt materials, the previous-children crossfade,
  nested canvases by readback) and D5 built — per-child textures, placements with
  depth, hit-testing and accessibility through them, the card deck (LLP 1014.000 §1a,
  §1b); two code reviews folded the same day (§1c: placements are the only place a
  placed child is; `clock`/`tap`/`type` settle the canvases before replying; a resize
  shows at once; the ABI checks its pointers). Left: Chrome's flag as the oracle for
  children *through* a surface; a hermetic test of the glass crossfade; LLP 1013 on
  this machinery. Delete this line then.
- `overflowX`/`overflowY` and `transition` in the Contract tag table (rows exist,
  attributes do not; LLP 1010 §5, LLP 1006 §8).
- Compile-time checking of attribute values against kernel rows; handler arity through
  a bare `action` prop (LLP 1006 §8's two circle-backs).
- `fitDocument` reading the root's `content` so the page's extent includes overflow
  past the root, as `scrollHeight` does (LLP 1010 §3's declared deviation).
- The untested-but-built list in LLP 1010 §5: horizontal scroll on macOS, `overflow:
  hidden` on the web, `hidden`/`visible` on a `ScrollView` on macOS — each a fixture.

## Open decisions (Charlie's)

- **LLP 1009** is `Review` while the canvas is built. Its §5 trades: the three
  gradient rows leave `schema.json` (done under LLP 1014 §5); amend NOT-DOING's "compiles no shaders at
  runtime" to "compiles nothing on the boot path"; the refine-loop take. Then the
  1009.000 spec transcribes the landing.
- **Linux painter: decided 2026-08-29 — vello on the GPU** (Charlie), with tiny-skia
  kept as the CPU fallback and the pixel oracle (LLP 1015 §7). What it owes: the
  NOT-DOING wording "compiles no shaders at runtime" now needs the clause "the GPU
  painter compiles its shaders on the first launch on a machine and reads them from
  the pipeline cache after" beside LLP 1009 §5's — Charlie's to write.
- **The app's name** (`rules/NOT-DOING.md` opens with it; the recommendation is
  Caltrain and Caltrain is what exists).

## Declared gaps, by system (each spec's "Not in v1")

- **Kernel / layout** (LLP 1001, 1010): `position: static`; `text_align: start`;
  presentation transforms in scrollable overflow; `overscroll-behavior`; scroll
  snapping; a scroll offset or event reaching the runner.
- **Motion** (LLP 1003 §9): layout transitions (gated on an incremental-relayout
  number); `@keyframes`; a Core Animation executor (measured question); reduced
  motion is the producer's `transition: none`.
- **Plan / runner** (LLP 1005 §8): a deps table and dirty-set sweep; per-instance
  derives or resources inside `each`; asynchronous data settlement.
- **Contract** (LLP 1006 §8): inlining budget; `contract` blocks as assertions;
  `cursor`; per-instance state; LSP and formatter; `linear()`.
- **Web host** (LLP 1007 §9): a text-measurement bridge (the kernel's layout does not
  run on the web — and nothing today checks the kernel's layout against the
  browser's; a layout parity corpus would be the analog of `parity.mjs`); gradients,
  grid, `line_clamp`, `font_family`; scroll position and focus across a reload;
  `prefers-reduced-motion`; a spring interrupted by an easing.
- **Apple host** (LLP 1008 §7): images; toggles; accessibility beyond `testId` and
  `accessibilityLabel`; justified text; per-corner radii; rubber-banding on inner
  scroll nodes; a generated header.
- **Linux host** (LLP 1015 §7): evdev has carried no real event yet; `canvas`; libinput and
  xkbcommon (acceleration, touchpad gestures, hotplug, non-US keymaps); Wayland/X11
  windows; selection, IME, a caret blink; `text_decoration`, `font_family`, RTL;
  shadows, gradients, grid; JPEG, image URLs; accessibility; a font cache; pixel
  fixtures against Chrome (needs a pinned font).
- **GPU** (LLP 1009 §4): readback bands for blending and MSAA; a generated module ABI
  once there is a second consumer; the `Custom(u16)` animatable-property extension
  when a surface needs it.

## Later

- **Windowed `List`** — when a list misses 60 fps. Needs three things the seam lacks
  (LLP 1010 §5): a logical total extent, window-origin compensation, and a
  scroll-offset event to the runner. `List` and `ScrollView` are the same thing on
  every host today.
- **iOS** on the Apple host's shape: the same package and batch, `NSView` → `UIView`.
  One of the v1 bar's four surfaces; cheaper than Linux.
- **Windows, Android** — `rules/NOT-DOING.md` §Surfaces; after the loop is proven.
- **ibex2** (`~/projects/ibex/crates/ibex2`; ibex LLP 0057 §5.2 targets Exact 2). Two
  things, two triggers (Charlie, 2026-08-29). `ibex2::host` — the Rust standard library
  (`fetch`/`fs`/`env` behind grants), `default-features = false`, no engine linked, no
  boot-graph change (ibex LLP 0068) — at the first `resource` that needs bytes from
  outside the process: image by URL, a real Caltrain feed. Build it together with the
  runner's asynchronous data settlement (LLP 1005 §8), which it needs anyway; ibex OQ2
  (a TLS transport off Apple) is owed before Linux consumes it. The engine (`hermes`
  feature) only at a measured call site, after v1, as another `DataSource` loaded on
  demand after first pixel (the GPU-module shape, LLP 1009 D2) — the plan, kernel, and
  Contract do not change. On the web the browser is the executor, so one module runs
  under two loaders; design that first. Zero app JS until then.
