# Pitfalls when writing exact2 apps

**Adding an entry:** only a pitfall you hit and reproduced on current `main`, written
as symptom → cause → what to do, with where it was found. Delete the entry in the
change that fixes the footgun, or that makes the compiler, runtime or driver
diagnose it. **Candidate diagnostic** marks one that could become a check cheaply.

Read [the agent guide](contract-for-agents.md) first. This list holds what that
guide's rules don't make obvious.

## Layout

- **An image tile grows to its picture's size.** An album tile in a flex row became
  900×1200 pt. Cause: a flex item's automatic minimum is its content size (CSS), and
  an image's content size is its intrinsic size. Fix: give the image or its flex
  parent `min-height=0` (`min-width=0` across a row), or position it absolutely in
  a sized box. (Signal Clone DIARY, build 7.)
- **A sized `symbol:` image is stretched.** An ellipsis became three tall bars.
  Cause: `object-fit` defaults to `fill`, as for `<img>`. Fix: add
  `object-fit="contain"` to every symbol with a `width`/`height`. (Signal Clone,
  2026-10-02.)
- **On iOS the whole window scrolls when the keyboard opens, and the header goes
  with it.** Cause: without `interactive-widget`, the root is not resized for the
  keyboard. Fix: `interactive-widget="resizes-content"` on the root, or
  `overlays-content` with a `role="toolbar" toolbarPlacement="keyboard"` for a
  toolbar that rides the keyboard without relayout (LLP 1008 §9.1). (Signal Clone.)

## Lists and scrolling

- **A tap that changes one row of a long list takes ~80 ms on the web.** Cause: the
  mutation answers the whole list (10,000 rows), and on the JS target a Rust
  module's answer crosses into JS as a copy and every row is checked again. Fix:
  make the list's resource a window (LLP 1027.004: `feed(cursor)` answering at most
  200 rows, `reachstart`/`reachend` on the `list` moving the cursor) and give the
  mutation `refreshes feed`: 16–24 ms. A development build on the JS target says so
  in `logs` (`big answer: <resource or mutation> … carries N list rows`) once an
  answer's longest list passes 2,000 rows (`host/web-js/seam.js`). (Heavy-list
  bench against Dioxus, 2026-10-03.)
- **A bounded list hitches at its first window shift, or its first tap is slow.**
  Cause: a Rust data source that parses or builds its data on first use does it
  then; the first window is baked into the plan, so the first query is the first
  `reachend` (or tap), on the main thread mid-scroll (75 ms for a 7 MB JSON on the
  web). Fix: do that work in `DataSource::activate`, which runs after first pixel.
  (Heavy-list bench, 2026-10-04.)
- **A transcript or feed should open at its newest row.** Writing `scrollTop` to a
  huge number lands short on a virtualized list by the estimate error of the rows
  it has not built (84 pt with `estimated-item-height=52`). Fix:
  `scroll-start="end"` on the `list` (LLP 1010 §6.5), not a `scrollTop` write or a
  `scrollIntoView` after the first command. (Signal Clone, build 4.)
- **The app works hard at rest.** Cause: it commits state on a timer (a clock
  written every 250 ms), so every tick is a batch and the host runs its whole
  post-apply pass (navigation, controls, menus, every scroller's position) four
  times a second; before `32805146` this also cut the reader's scrolling. Fix:
  write state only when it changes (a minute-resolution clock; poll fast only while
  something is in flight), and remove `scroll=` handlers left over from
  experiments: each commits per scroll frame. (Signal Clone, build 2; QUEUE has
  the host side.)

## Native presentation and navigation (iOS)

- **Edge-swipe back does nothing.** Cause: the pop gesture presses the control named
  by the root's `navigationBack`; with no such enabled control in the active route
  it is refused (the log says "back gesture refused"). Fix: `navigationBack="back"`
  on the root and an `id="back"` button on every pushed screen (LLP 1038 §6).
  **Candidate diagnostic:** the compiler could warn on a stacked route with no
  control of that id.
- **The agent's screenshots and tree don't show the native bars.** Under
  `scripts/agent.mjs` the navigation bar, tab bar, `UIMenu`s and header search are
  not presented; the authored header, tablist and popover paint instead, by design.
  To see native chrome, launch normally and take `xcrun simctl io <udid>
  screenshot`. (Signal Clone, builds 5 and 10.)
- **An overlay's backdrop stops at the navigation or tab bar.** Cause: content
  inside a route draws under the native bars. Fix: render full-screen overlays
  (menus, action sheets) as root children after the tab container, or as a
  `navigationPresentation="fullscreen"` route. (Signal Clone, build 10.)
- **A link in the app's own scheme never matches.** `signalclone://connect?x=1`
  reaches the root's `navigate` handler as the location `/connect?x=1`: the scheme
  is dropped and the host becomes the first path segment (`location_of`, LLP 1038
  D8). Fix: match on the path (`startsWith(location, "/connect?")`), not the URL.
  (Signal Clone, phone path.)
- **VoiceOver reads the screen behind a full-screen overlay.** A call screen
  or menu drawn as a root child above the bars hides the chat list from sight,
  not from VoiceOver: it still reached the rows and the native tab bar behind.
  Fix: `role="dialog" aria-modal=true` (or `role="alertdialog"`) on the
  overlay's root (LLP 1080.003); on iOS its siblings, the tab container and its
  bars among them, are then skipped while it shows. (Signal Clone, build 13.)
- **With `viewport-fit="cover"`, route content goes under the native bar.** Cause:
  the bar's cover is added to the route's padding, but a cover-fit root has no top
  safe area. Fix: put `env(safe-area-inset-top)` on the route column, not on each
  authored header. (Signal Clone, build 5.)

## Input

- **A hold's `pointerup` never arrives.** Cause: the press started on a node that a
  state change replaced during the hold; the up is not delivered to a node that no
  longer exists (declared in LLP 1005). Fix: keep the pressed node across the state
  change (change its contents, not which branch renders it).
  **Candidate diagnostic:** the runtime could log a dropped up in development.
- **A `transformDragFor` handle does nothing.** No pinch or drag follows and
  nothing is logged. Cause: the binding resolves only for a strict shape and
  otherwise returns none silently (`kernel/src/transform.rs`; only the agent's
  transform-drag command reports "no photo binding"). The target, the handle's one
  ancestor with that `id`, needs
  `width="100%" height="100%" box-sizing="border-box"`, no padding, border,
  margin or offsets, and its direct parent needs `overflow="hidden"` on both axes
  and no padding or border; every other ancestor must be untransformed. (Signal
  Clone, build 11: the photo viewer lacked `overflow="hidden"` and
  `box-sizing`.) **Candidate diagnostic:** the compiler or a development log
  could name the failed condition.

## Driving and testing

- **Every date in a screenshot is 1 January 2026** (31 December 2025 west of UTC).
  Cause: the agent's clock starts at `2026-01-01T00:00:00Z`, in UTC. Fix: `--epoch <ISO time> --time-zone <zone>` on
  `scripts/agent.mjs` for dates that read as intended and stay reproducible.
- **`axe` stops delivering taps.** After `axe touch --down --up --delay` (a long
  press) or an `axe drag`, a following `axe tap` often reaches no window; it is
  intermittent, and a native bar button can miss the same way with no gesture
  before it. `axe touch --down --up` lands more often, not always. Fix: use the
  agent's own taps where it can; with `axe`, tap by touch, check every step with
  `axe describe-ui` before the next, and `xcrun simctl shutdown` / `boot` the
  simulator when taps stop landing. `axe` also cannot press tab bar items or
  `UIMenu` rows. (Signal Clone, builds 10 and 11; reproduced on `05d0c576e`.)

## Working on exact2 itself

- **Conformance fails on apps you didn't touch.** Cause: `host/web-js/conform.mjs`
  compares against wasm dists under `--wasm-root` (default `/tmp/e3-wasm`, shared by
  every checkout), and without `--build` it uses whatever another checkout or an
  older commit left there. Fix: name the apps and pass `--build` with a
  `--wasm-root` of your own (`conform.mjs <app> --build --strict --wasm-root
  /tmp/<yours>`). With no apps named, an empty root compares nothing and passes.
- **A web size or speed number is inflated.** Cause: a development web build
  carries the agent adapter, install pages and the source map. Fix: measure the
  release: `host/web-js/build.mjs <app> --plan <wasm bake>/app.plan --production`,
  as `scripts/deploy.mjs` builds it.
- **Host code must never set a scroll offset during a pan or fling.** An absolute
  `contentOffset` write while `isTracking`/`isDecelerating` cuts the reader's
  motion: frame rate holds, the motion is wrong ("janky but not dropping frames").
  Defer follows to the end of the drag or deceleration, and apply anchoring and
  estimate corrections as relative adjustments in the same layout pass (Signal
  Clone evening of 2026-10-02; `32805146`, `c03685dc`).
- **An iOS app builds, but its driver cannot find `simctl`.** Cause: `xcode-select`
  points at Command Line Tools; the Apple builder supplies Xcode's
  `DEVELOPER_DIR` for its own subprocesses, while the separate driver inherits
  the shell. Fix: set `DEVELOPER_DIR=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer`
  when running `test ios` or `agent ios`. (CSS diary-fix scratch app, 2026-10-04;
  reproduced with `xcrun simctl list` in the origin/main source copy.)
