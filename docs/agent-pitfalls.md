# Pitfalls when writing exact2 apps

**Adding an entry:** only a pitfall you hit and reproduced on current `main`, written
as symptom → cause → what to do, with where it was found. Delete the entry in the
change that fixes the footgun, or that makes the compiler, runtime or driver
diagnose it. **Candidate diagnostic** marks one that could become a check cheaply.

Read [the agent guide](contract-for-agents.md) first. This list holds what that
guide's rules don't make obvious.

## Layout

- **A heading's lines are a screen apart with `line-height=28`.** Cause: a bare
  number is CSS's unitless `line-height`, a multiple of the font size (at 22 px,
  28 × 22 = 616 px), unlike a bare number on a length row such as `font-size` or
  `width`, which means pixels. Fix: write `line-height="28px"`, or a ratio such as
  `line-height=1.3` (28.6 px at 22 px). (Authoring bench,
  LLP 1087: three Codex builders, caught only by a screenshot, 2026-10-05.)

- **An image tile grows to its picture's size.** An album tile in a flex row became
  900×1200 pt. Cause: a flex item's automatic minimum is its content size (CSS), and
  an image's content size is its intrinsic size. Fix: give the image or its flex
  parent `min-height=0` (`min-width=0` across a row), or position it absolutely in
  a sized box. (Signal Clone DIARY, build 7.)
- **A sized `symbol:` image is stretched.** An ellipsis became three tall bars.
  Cause: `object-fit` defaults to `fill`, as for `<img>`. Fix: add
  `object-fit="contain"` to every symbol with a `width`/`height`. (Signal Clone,
  2026-10-02.)
- **On iOS the whole window scrolls when the keyboard opens, and the header goes
  with it.** Cause: without `interactive-widget`, the root is not resized for the
  keyboard. Fix: `interactive-widget="resizes-content"` on the root, or
  `overlays-content` with a `role="toolbar" toolbarPlacement="keyboard"` for a
  toolbar that rides the keyboard without relayout (LLP 1008 §9.1). (Signal Clone.)

- **The app is wider than the window, and its tests still pass.** A root with
  `width="100%"` and `padding=24` is 48 points too wide: sizes are `content-box`, as
  on the web, so padding adds to the width. Buttons at the right edge are cut off,
  and an `expect` never sees it. Fix: `box-sizing="border-box"` on any box sized in
  percent that also has padding or a border (`exact new`'s template does), and
  `min-width=0` on a `flex=1` input in a row. Look at a screenshot on each host.
  (Fresh-agent README trial, 2026-10-04.)

- **A raised `z-index` leaves a dragged card under the next column.** A card at
  `position="relative" z-index=10`, dragged over a neighbouring column, paints
  beneath it. Cause: `z-index` orders siblings, not a whole stacking context as in
  CSS (a declared deviation, [LLP 1001](../llp/1001-kernel-v1.spec.md) "`z-index`
  orders siblings"), and on the web a box that follows a positioned or stacked box
  becomes a paint group (`isolation: isolate`). A child cannot rise above its
  parent's later siblings. Fix: raise the ancestor that is a sibling of the others
  (the card's column, while it holds the dragged card), or draw the dragged card in
  an overlay at the board level. (Authoring bench, LLP 1087, t4-kanban: two builders,
  5 and 10 minutes, 2026-10-04.)

- **The content of an overlay vanishes behind its own background.** Cause: a
  background box with `position="absolute"` (a dimmer, a gradient) paints
  over every later sibling that is not positioned, as CSS orders it. Before
  LLP 1083.000 the Apple hosts painted in tree order and hid this. Fix: give
  the content `position="relative"`, or give the background `z-index=-1`
  inside a parent that stacks. (Signal Clone's call screen, build 16.)

## Lists and scrolling

- **A tap that changes one row of a long list takes ~80 ms on the web.** Cause: the
  mutation answers the whole list (10,000 rows), and on the JS target a Rust
  module's answer crosses into JS as a copy and every row is checked again. Fix:
  make the list's resource a window (LLP 1027.004: `feed(cursor)` answering at most
  200 rows, `reachstart`/`reachend` on the `list` moving the cursor) and give the
  mutation `refreshes feed`: 16–24 ms. A development build on the JS target says so
  in `logs` (`big answer: <resource or mutation> … carries N list rows`) once an
  answer's longest list passes 2,000 rows (`host/web-js/seam.js`). (Heavy-list
  bench against Dioxus, 2026-10-03.)
- **A bounded list hitches at its first window shift, or its first tap is slow.**
  Cause: a Rust data source that parses or builds its data on first use does it
  then; the first window is baked into the plan, so the first query is the first
  `reachend` (or tap), on the main thread mid-scroll (75 ms for a 7 MB JSON on the
  web). Fix: do that work in `DataSource::activate`, which runs after first pixel.
  (Heavy-list bench, 2026-10-04.)
- **A transcript or feed should open at its newest row.** Writing `scrollTop` to a
  huge number lands short on a virtualized list by the estimate error of the rows
  it has not built (84 pt with `estimated-item-height=52`). Fix:
  `scroll-start="end"` on the `list` (LLP 1010 §6.5), not a `scrollTop` write or a
  `scrollIntoView` after the first command. (Signal Clone, build 4.)
- **The app works hard at rest.** Cause: it commits state on a timer (a clock
  written every 250 ms), so every tick is a batch and the host runs its whole
  post-apply pass (navigation, controls, menus, every scroller's position) four
  times a second; before `32805146` this also cut the reader's scrolling. Fix:
  write state only when it changes (a minute-resolution clock; poll fast only while
  something is in flight), and remove `scroll=` handlers left over from
  experiments: each commits per scroll frame. (Signal Clone, build 2; QUEUE has
  the host side.)

- **A custom row in a grouped list overflows its card on the right.** Cause:
  the sheet already gives each row its margin (16 pt, or 56 pt after an icon)
  and a 16-pt trailing padding. A custom row with `width="100%"` adds the
  margin on top and runs 16 pt past the card. Fix: leave custom row content
  at its natural width (`flex-grow=1` on the part that should stretch), not
  `width="100%"`. (Signal Clone, build 15.)

- **A data answer past 16 MiB fails only on the JS target.** A 64 MiB string from
  a Rust source loaded on the wasm web host and on Linux, and on the JS target
  the resource failed (`Rust module rejected the call`). Cause: the JS target's
  Rust data seam carries at most `MAX_HOST_WORK_BYTES` (16 MiB) a message; the
  runner's own data source has no such cap. Keep an answer under 16 MiB, or page
  it. (LLP 1090 conformance plan, `host/web-js/conformance/budget.contract`.)

## Native presentation and navigation (iOS)

- **Edge-swipe back does nothing.** Cause: the pop gesture presses the control named
  by the root's `navigationBack`; with no such enabled control in the active route
  it is refused (the log says "back gesture refused"). Fix: `navigationBack="back"`
  on the root and an `id="back"` button on every pushed screen (LLP 1038 §6).
  **Candidate diagnostic:** the compiler could warn on a stacked route with no
  control of that id.
- **A pushed screen's content is cut off and never scrolls, or its large title never
  collapses.** Cause: a route is a box, not a scroller, and `navigationScroll` only
  names one; a title collapses only with the scroller right after the route's
  `header`. Fix: a `scroll id="feed" flex=1 min-height=0` right after the `header`
  and `navigationScroll="feed"` on the route (docs/contract-for-agents.md, "Routes and
  web documents"). The compiler refuses a name nothing in the route carries, or one
  on a box that never scrolls (`lower-route-scroll`). **Candidate diagnostics:** the
  compiler could refuse a named scroller that is not right after the `header` (an
  iOS-only rule today, so not refused); the hosts could journal a route whose
  content overflows with nothing to scroll it (QUEUE.md).
- **A sheet won't swipe down to dismiss.** It springs back (the log says "modal
  dismissal refused: no enabled navigationBack control in the active route").
  Cause: as for edge-swipe back, the swipe presses the control named by the root's
  `navigationBack`, and a `navigationPresentation="modal"` route with no enabled
  control of that id refuses it; `closedby="none"` refuses it too. Fix: an
  `id="back"` button (Cancel, Done) in every sheet (`ModalIOS.swift`,
  `refusesDismissal`). (Exact-new iOS app feedback, 2026-10-04.)
- **The app looks like an imitation of iOS.** Cause: controls built from boxes
  (a painted switch, buttons laid out as a tab bar or a title bar, rows drawn as a
  grouped list). Fix: the native Contract forms
  ([the agent guide](contract-for-agents.md#views-layout-and-interaction), "Prefer
  native controls"); a hand-built lookalike of a system control is a bug. Match a
  reference's structure and controls, not its pixels. (Exact-new iOS app feedback,
  2026-10-04.)
- **The agent's screenshots and tree don't show the native bars.** Under
  `scripts/agent.mjs` the navigation bar, tab bar, `UIMenu`s and header search are
  not presented; the authored header, tablist and popover paint instead, by design.
  To see native chrome, launch normally and take `xcrun simctl io <udid>
  screenshot`. (Signal Clone, builds 5 and 10.)
- **An overlay's backdrop stops at the navigation or tab bar.** Cause: content
  inside a route draws under the native bars. Fix: render full-screen overlays
  (menus, action sheets) as root children after the tab container, or as a
  `navigationPresentation="fullscreen"` route. (Signal Clone, build 10.)
- **A link in the app's own scheme never matches.** `signalclone://connect?x=1`
  reaches the root's `navigate` handler as the location `/connect?x=1`: the scheme
  is dropped and the host becomes the first path segment (`location_of`, LLP 1038
  D8). Fix: match on the path (`startsWith(location, "/connect?")`), not the URL.
  (Signal Clone, phone path.)
- **VoiceOver reads the screen behind a full-screen overlay.** A call screen
  or menu drawn as a root child above the bars hides the chat list from sight,
  not from VoiceOver: it still reached the rows and the native tab bar behind.
  Fix: `role="dialog" aria-modal=true` on the overlay's root (LLP 1080.003); on
  iOS its siblings, the tab container and its bars among them, are then skipped
  while it shows. (Signal Clone, build 13.) Not `role="alertdialog"` on content
  you lay out: see the next entry.
- **`role="alertdialog"` refuses a dialog laid out in a `column`.**
  `lower-alertdialog: … a `column` row is not text, an action or the cancel`.
  Cause: an `alertdialog` popover or `dialog` is a native confirmation (LLP
  1021: iOS's sheet, macOS's menu), whose rows can only be text, buttons that
  close it, and one cancel. Fix: give a modal you lay out yourself `role="dialog"
  aria-modal=true`; keep `alertdialog` for a flat list of text and buttons.
  (x2apps onboarding's Delete account?, 2026-10-04.)
- **`tabIndex` on a module tag is refused.** `` `paint-surface` has no attribute
  `tabIndex`; `tabIndex` is spelled `tabindex` here ``. Cause: HTML's
  `tabindex` is now an attribute on every element and module tag's box (LLP
  1088 D7.3), with no DOM-property alias. Fix: write `tabindex` (x2apps paint,
  2026-10-04).
- **With `viewport-fit="cover"`, route content goes under the native bar.** Cause:
  the bar's cover is added to the route's padding, but a cover-fit root has no top
  safe area. Fix: put `env(safe-area-inset-top)` on the route column, not on each
  authored header. (Signal Clone, build 5.)

## Actions

- **A helper action does not see what its caller just assigned.** `sel = next`
  then `follow()`, with `follow` reading `sel`, would read the old `sel`: a call
  is its callee's statements in the caller's one commit, and every statement
  reads the state the action started with (LLP 1089 D2). The compiler refuses the
  read (`analyze-call-stale-read`), naming both lines. Fix: pass the value the
  helper should see, `follow(next)`, or a `let` bound before the assignment for
  the old one. (Spreadsheet F21 and Files F27 diaries, where a copied block was
  the workaround.)

- **A delete or save is lost when the page reloads right after it.** An action that
  `send`s a write and navigates away in the same commit passes every test, but a
  browser reload in the next ~100 ms comes back without the write. Cause: the write
  is the data module's, and it is done only when its mutation answers; the reload
  ends the page first. Fix: navigate in the mutation's `then`, which runs once the
  write has answered. (Authoring bench, LLP 1087, a2-contacts and t2-todo, 2026-10-05.)

## Input

- **A hold's `pointerup` never arrives.** Cause: the press started on a node that a
  state change replaced during the hold; the up is not delivered to a node that no
  longer exists (declared in LLP 1005). Fix: keep the pressed node across the state
  change (change its contents, not which branch renders it).
  **Candidate diagnostic:** the runtime could log a dropped up in development.
- **A `transformDragFor` handle does nothing.** No pinch or drag follows and
  nothing is logged. Cause: the binding resolves only for a strict shape and
  otherwise returns none silently (`kernel/src/transform.rs`; only the agent's
  transform-drag command reports "no photo binding"). The target, the handle's one
  ancestor with that `id`, needs
  `width="100%" height="100%" box-sizing="border-box"`, no padding, border,
  margin or offsets, and its direct parent needs `overflow="hidden"` on both axes
  and no padding or border; every other ancestor must be untransformed. (Signal
  Clone, build 11: the photo viewer lacked `overflow="hidden"` and
  `box-sizing`.) **Candidate diagnostic:** the compiler or a development log
  could name the failed condition.

- **A text field shows an edit its action refused.** A field bound with
  `value=text input=edit`, where `edit` ignores a blank value, shows the blank while
  `text` keeps the old value, and the next keystroke builds on what is shown. Cause: on
  the web (both targets) a text field is re-set only when its bound value changes, so
  an unchanged binding does not overwrite the edit. Fix: bind the field to draft state that `edit` always writes, and on commit
  (`change`, Enter, `blur`) write the accepted value or reset the draft to it, which
  changes the bound value and redraws the field. (Authoring bench, LLP 1087, t2-todo:
  two builders, about 10 minutes each, 2026-10-04.)

- **A `pan` hears nothing from a finger on the web.** A drag with
  `tap <id> drag dx dy` (or a real touch) moves nothing and logs nothing. Cause:
  without `touch-action="none"` on the pan's box the browser takes the touch for
  scrolling and the pointer events are cancelled. Fix: `touch-action="none"` on the
  dragged box (only that box, so the page still scrolls from elsewhere). (Authoring
  bench, LLP 1087, t4-kanban: about 15 minutes, 2026-10-04.) **Candidate
  diagnostic:** the compiler could warn on a `pan` without `touch-action`.

- **There is no `swipeleft` for swipe-to-delete.** A row built from `pan`,
  `panrelease` and `translate` reveals its Delete button, but by hand on every host.
  Cause: `swiperight` is the reply gesture (a message bubble), not a direction pair;
  the row whose leading or trailing actions a swipe reveals is a horizontal `scroll`
  with `scroll-snap-type="x mandatory"`, its content and action buttons as snap
  children, naming them with `swipeContent`, `swipeLeading` and `swipeTrailing` ids,
  which the web scrolls and iOS turns into UIKit's own swipe actions. Fix: copy
  `apps/messages/app.contract`'s inbox row (`thread-swipe-…`). (Ledger2 DIARY, "Needed:
  swipe gesture", about 15 minutes, 2026-10-04.)

- **A write left running after a source answers can be lost on iOS or macOS.** The
  web kept it; the native host did not, and a list was empty after a relaunch. Cause:
  the native data executor runs a source's promises while a request waits on them,
  one request at a time, so a `promise` started and not awaited (a fire-and-forget
  SQLite write) can stay unfinished, and an answer queues behind a request still in
  flight. Fix: await the write before answering, or carry it in a
  request of its own that the view sends (a `flush` source called with the change).
  (Authoring bench, LLP 1087, t2-todo on iOS: about 20 minutes, 2026-10-05.)

- **Two quick sends to one mutation lost the first write on iOS.** Two adds in a
  row (`send changed = addTask(…)` from consecutive inputs) kept only the second:
  the log said `forget request 11 (changed)`, and the first insert, queued behind
  a storage turn still open, never landed; the web finished it. Cause: a second `send` to a mutation
  forgets the request in flight (its reply is dropped by design); the native
  executor finishes a forgotten request already in a storage step, but drops one
  that has not reached its first (QUEUE). Fix until then: give each write that can
  be in flight at once a mutation of its own, or keep the edits in Contract state and
  send the whole of it each time, from the value assigned (`let next = …`, then
  `tasks = next` and `send saved = saveTasks(next)`: a statement reads the state the
  action started with), so a later request that supersedes an earlier one already
  carries every change. (Authoring
  bench, LLP 1087, t2-todo on iOS, 2026-10-05.)

## Driving and testing

- **A drive script kept in the app folder makes the build stale.** Editing
  `verify.mjs` beside `app.contract` made the driver refuse the next drive until
  `bun exact.mjs web-build`. Cause: a file in the app folder counts as a build input
  unless it is an output (a screenshot, a log) or git-ignored outside the input trees
  (`data/`, `web/`, `assets/` and the like count even when ignored). Fix: keep drive
  scripts outside the app folder. (Authoring
  bench, LLP 1087: five builders, 2026-10-05.)

- **An iOS screenshot right after a tap shows a segmented control on its old
  segment.** The tree says the new one is selected. Cause: UIKit animates the
  selection on real time, and `clock +N` does not move it. Fix: `clock +1000 real`
  before the screenshot (it moves the app's clock that second too, so a timer due in
  it fires). (Authoring bench, t1-tip on iOS, 2026-10-05.)

- **The same test passes on the web and fails on iOS at a date past `max`.** Cause:
  the runner refuses a date, time or datetime outside `min`/`max` (the agent says the
  date was refused) on iOS, macOS, Linux and the wasm web; the JS web target keeps the
  value as a browser's date input does. Fix: test values inside the range, or the
  bound itself. (Authoring bench, t7-wizard on iOS,
  2026-10-05.)

- **The agent taps the simulator by screen coordinates** (`axe tap -x -y`,
  `simctl`), and the drive breaks whenever layout moves. Cause: the controls have
  no `testId`, or the driver was not used on iOS. Fix: give every control a
  `testId` and drive with `bun exact.mjs agent ios tree "tap <testId>"
  "screenshot s.png"`; find targets with `tree`, or `tree --ax` for the
  accessibility tree. (Exact-new iOS app feedback, 2026-10-04.)

- **Every date in a screenshot is 1 January 2026** (31 December 2025 west of UTC).
  Cause: the agent's clock starts at `2026-01-01T00:00:00Z`, in UTC. Fix: `--epoch <ISO time> --time-zone <zone>` on
  `scripts/agent.mjs` for dates that read as intended and stay reproducible; in a test
  file, `epoch "…"` and `time-zone "…"` lines, so a run without the flags still means it.
- **`axe` stops delivering taps.** Use `axe` only as a last resort, for native
  chrome only a normal launch presents (bars, `UIMenu`s); drive everything else
  with `agent ios` by `testId`. After `axe touch --down --up --delay` (a long
  press) or an `axe drag`, a following `axe tap` often reaches no window; it is
  intermittent, and a native bar button can miss the same way with no gesture
  before it. `axe touch --down --up` lands more often, not always. Fix: use the
  agent's own taps where it can; with `axe`, tap by touch, check every step with
  `axe describe-ui` before the next, and `xcrun simctl shutdown` / `boot` the
  simulator when taps stop landing. `axe` also cannot press tab bar items or
  `UIMenu` rows. (Signal Clone, builds 10 and 11; reproduced on `05d0c576e`.)
- **A `UISwitch` does not flip under `axe tap -x -y`.** Cause: a tap by
  coordinates resolves no element, so `--tap-style automatic` sends the
  simulator's own tap, a touch with no duration, and iOS 27's `UISwitch`
  ignores it: a bare UIKit app's switch does not flip either. A grouped
  list's toggle (LLP 1084) looks broken while its app logic is fine. Fix:
  `axe tap --id <testId>` (a switch element gets a physical touch),
  `axe tap -x <x> -y <y> --tap-style physical`, or
  `axe touch -x <x> -y <y> --down --up`; or the agent's `tap <testId>`.
  (Signal Clone Privacy, 2026-10-04.)

- **The software keyboard never shows on a simulator that drives have used.**
  A field takes focus (its caret blinks) but no keyboard rises, and
  `keyboardWillShow` never fires, so a keyboard-riding toolbar cannot be
  measured. Cause: after agent and `axe` drives the simulator was in
  hardware-keyboard mode, likely left by the HID input they inject; a
  headless simulator has no Simulator.app setting to show. Fix: reboot it
  (`xcrun simctl shutdown <udid>; xcrun simctl boot <udid>`), or toggle
  Connect Hardware Keyboard where Simulator.app is installed. (Signal Clone
  keyboard timing, 2026-10-05.)

- **A storage test fails with `storage is busy`, or storage is "unavailable in
  agent mode".** Cause: a drive has no storage unless it names a scratch store, and
  an open SQLite database locks its file, so a mutation and the refresh it triggers
  collide. Fix: `--storage <name>` on an `agent` drive (authored tests get a
  store of their own), and queue every `storage.sqlite.open` in `app.ts`
  ([the human guide](contract-for-humans.md#writing-the-data-module) shows one).
  (LLP 1086 reading-list example, 2026-10-04.)

## Working on exact2 itself

- **A platform feature looks missing, and you start building it.** Cause: the
  feature already exists under a name you did not search for. Haptics
  (`haptic()`, `press-haptic`) were proposed as a new gap after they had
  landed. Fix: before calling something missing, search
  `docs/contract-for-agents.md` and the LLP index (`ls llp/`, then `grep -ril
  <term> llp`). Name the LLP that lacks it when you report the gap. (Signal
  Clone, 2026-10-04.)

- **Conformance fails on apps you didn't touch.** Cause: `host/web-js/conform.mjs`
  compares against wasm dists under `--wasm-root` (default `/tmp/e3-wasm`, shared by
  every checkout), and without `--build` it uses whatever another checkout or an
  older commit left there. Fix: name the apps and pass `--build` with a
  `--wasm-root` of your own (`conform.mjs <app> --build --strict --wasm-root
  /tmp/<yours>`). With no apps named, an empty root compares nothing and passes.
- **A web size or speed number is inflated.** Cause: a development web build
  carries the agent adapter, install pages and the source map. Fix: measure the
  release: `host/web-js/build.mjs <app> --plan <wasm bake>/app.plan --production`,
  as `scripts/deploy.mjs` builds it.
  The current `metrics.mjs` app.js gate is a different measurement: it calls
  `host/web/build.mjs <app>-web` without `--production`, and prints its three
  app.js lines only with `--long`. Reproduce that invocation when investigating
  a gate violation; a release number cannot be substituted for it.
- **Host code must never set a scroll offset during a pan or fling.** An absolute
  `contentOffset` write while `isTracking`/`isDecelerating` cuts the reader's
  motion: frame rate holds, the motion is wrong ("janky but not dropping frames").
  Defer follows to the end of the drag or deceleration, and apply anchoring and
  estimate corrections as relative adjustments in the same layout pass (Signal
  Clone evening of 2026-10-02; `32805146`, `c03685dc`).
- **A fixture's nonempty list literal does not compile.** Contract admits `[]`
  only; a nonempty list comes from a source, a shape field, or `map`/`filter`.
  `split` is not a standard function here either. (Paint-order mutation fixture, 2026-10-04.)
- **A copied Core Animation tree renders blank.** Calling `CALayer(layer:)`
  directly gives an empty layer: a measured copy had zero bounds and no fill
  or sublayers. For a capture, copy values into fresh layers and recursively
  copy children and masks. Keep the live hierarchy intact. (LLP 1083.000, Apple A2.)
- **A nonempty list literal does not compile.** Contract admits `[]` only; a
  nonempty list comes from a source, a shape field, or `map`/`filter`, and
  `split` is not a standard function. For a fixture or a static mount
  measurement, generate the repeated markup. (LLP 1083.000, web W2 and Apple A2.)
- **An sRGB capture test changes the pixel it reads.** AppKit's
  `NSBitmapImageRep.colorAt` returns calibrated RGB even when the bitmap is
  sRGB. Converting that `NSColor` to sRGB again turned measured bytes
  `[128, 0, 127, 255]` into about 58% red and 57% blue. Compare the bitmap's
  components or bytes in its declared color space. (Apple A2 capture test.)
- **A canvas capture still shows the previous order after ranks flush.**
  Cached shadow layers are plain `CALayer`s: changing their `zPosition`
  outside a disabled-actions transaction implicitly animates the depth.
  Flush ranks before capture and disable actions for that flush, including
  mirror writes. A same-batch texture upload then sees the new front sibling.
  (LLP 1083.000, Astra 6 regression.)
