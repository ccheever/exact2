# game/ — the game engine add-on

An agent-native game engine on exact2, as an **add-on**: its own Cargo workspace,
absent from the root `members`, so the five checks never compile it and an app
without a world carries none of it (LLP 1041 §5). The record of why is LLP 1041 and
its sub-documents; this file is the map and the rules. The code is the authority.

## The one idea

**A world is a guest in a `canvas`**, as a web page is a guest in an `iframe`
(LLP 1020). A game is an ordinary exact2 app — Contract for every screen, a manifest,
a bake, delivery — plus one module holding the simulation *and* its renderer in one
memory, loaded after first pixel like any GPU module. Game UI is the app engine:
canvas children are the HUD, a placement is a sign in the world.

## Layout

| | |
|---|---|
| `engine/` | `exact-game` — the simulation: world, data, ticks, input, scene, the agent's reads. **No GPU, no host.** |
| `app/` | `exact-game-app` — the shared Rust-only bake for game UIs without data sources. |
| `derive/` | `exact-game-derive` — `#[derive(Data)]`, `#[derive(Component)]`, `#[derive(Args)]`. No `syn`. |
| `render/` | `exact-game-render` — the wgpu renderer and `WorldSurface`, the `exact_gpu::Surface` a canvas binds. |
| `physics/`, `audio/`, `bake/` | as they land |
| `games/` | consumers: `greybox` (LLP 1041.000 S0), `beacons` |
| `bench/`, `twins/` | the same scenes here, in Godot 4 and in three.js; numbers, never checks |
| `diaries/` | what building with it was like, scored against the twins |

## The programming model

The complete example below is compiled and run by `cargo test --doc -p exact-game`.

```rust
use exact_game::*;

#[derive(Default, Args)]
struct Options {
    seed: u64,
    #[live]
    paused: bool,
}
#[derive(Default, Component)]
struct Beacon { glow: Spring }
struct SmallGame;
impl Game for SmallGame {
    const ID: &'static str = "small-game";
    type Args = Options;
    fn actions() -> Actions {
        Actions::new().stick("move", Stick::wasd().or_arrows())
            .button("light", &["KeyE"])
    }
    fn setup(w: &mut World, args: &Options) {
        w.reseed(args.seed);
        w.spawn((Transform::default(), Mesh::plane(40.0, 40.0), Material::default()));
        let player = w.spawn_named("player", (Transform::at(0.0, 0.9, 0.0), Mesh::capsule(0.4, 1.8), Material::rgb(0.8, 0.4, 0.1)));
        w.spawn_named("camera", (Transform::default(), Camera::default(),
            Follow::new(player).offset(0.0, 9.0, 13.0).lag(0.15)));
        w.spawn((Transform::at(2.0, 0.5, 0.0), Mesh::sphere(0.5), Material::default(), Beacon::default()));
        w.publish("lit", 0);
        scene::follow(w);
    }
    fn paused(args: &Options) -> bool { args.paused }
    fn tick(w: &mut World, input: &Input, _: &Options) {
        w.get_mut::<Transform>("player").unwrap().position +=
            input.stick_xz("move") * 4.0 * w.dt();
        let mut count = 0;
        for (mut beacon, mut material) in w.query::<(&mut Beacon, &mut Material)>() {
            if input.pressed("light") { beacon.glow.set_target(w.now(), 1.0); }
            material.emissive = [beacon.glow.value(w.now()) * 3.0; 3];
            count += u32::from(beacon.glow.target == 1.0);
        }
        w.publish("lit", count);
        scene::follow(w);
    }
}
fn main() {
    let mut game = Sim::<SmallGame>::new(Options { seed: 7, paused: false }).unwrap();
    game.tap("KeyE");
    assert!(game.settle());
    assert_eq!(game.world().published("lit").unwrap().as_number(), Some(1.0));
    assert!(game.world().get::<Transform>("camera").unwrap().position.y > 9.0);
}
```

- **A tick is a function that calls functions.** No scheduler, no plugins, no
  system parameters. Physics is `physics::step(world)`, written where it runs.
- **All state is in the `World`, and all of it is `Data`**: one derive gives the
  save game, the hash, the agent's JSON, the level file, and what a dev reload
  carries. A `Game` has no fields.
- **Arguments are a struct; field order is canvas order.** `#[derive(Args)]`
  supports bool, u32/u64, i32/i64, f32/f64, and String (`()` for none).
  Unmarked fields construct; `#[live]` fields are read each tick.
  Integer bounds are checked before casting; 64-bit fields accept safe f64 integers. A timed
  `bind(values, Some(at_ms))` validates first, seeks under the old arguments, then
  swaps. `Game::validate` runs before construction, binding, seeking for a bind, or restore; a refusal changes nothing. Hosts construct with `Sim::from_values`. Saves encode argument fields by name: reordering is safe, additions default, removals are ignored. Saves carry the game's `ID` and
  `SAVE_VERSION`, world time and dynamic input; the first restored host clock
  establishes a new epoch.
- **Time is an input.** `tick = floor(clock_ms × hz / 1000)`; a step is `1/hz`
  exactly; there is no `delta`. Rendering interpolates between the last two ticks,
  so motion is smooth at any refresh rate and the simulation never knows.
- **Names are first class.** `world.get::<Transform>("fox")` accepts a name or an entity handle; `world:fox` addresses it in the agent. Consuming `query()` yields guarded items (mutable bindings use `mut`); `.iter()` yields `(Entity, item)` with plain references. `.one()` returns an item and refuses multiple matches in all builds.
- **Iteration is in entity order, always** — storage scans presence bitmasks in
  ascending index order, so a world loaded from a save replays exactly as the one
  that wrote it.

## Determinism — the contract (LLP 1041.001 D5)

Same seed, same inputs, same clock ⇒ the same `world.hash()`, on every host, bit for
bit. What that costs, and the only rules a game author must remember:

1. No clock but the world's. No randomness but `world.rng()`.
2. Transcendentals come from `exact_game::math` (libm), never `f32::sin`.
3. No `HashMap` iteration in a tick, no threads in a tick.
4. State lives in components and resources, nowhere else.

Pixels are held to a band; simulation state is held exactly.

## Publications and events

`World::publish("beacons", count)` updates the current public record. Contract reads
it with `resource hud = exactSurface("world") as shape Hud`; absent fields default
and extra keys are ignored. It needs no app data module. `Sim::take_published`
drains changed state; a rebuilt or restored simulation publishes again.
The first live canvas owns its surface name: other instances cannot publish or clear its record and produce one diagnostic naming the surface.
`World::emit("won")` separately queues a string for the canvas's `message=` handler.
Undelivered events are saved in order. An empty queue adds no world save bytes.

## The agent's interface

No ninth operation (LLP 1041.001). `tree`, `state`, `layout`, `logs` and `clock`
reach the world through one export on the module; an entity is a target
(`world:fox`); `clock` is the only thing that moves the world; the journal is how an
agent hears. Capture the complete simulation with `s.screenshot('run.world', 'world', 'save')`
(CLI: `screenshot run.world world save`). `open({world: 'run.world'})` or
`--world run.world` holds the bytes until Play creates the first carrying surface,
then restores before its first render. Web, macOS and the iOS Simulator use the
same forms. Both carriers refuse input files and captures above 256 MiB before
reading/encoding the carrier. A refused restore is reported once by the creating
operation and remains in that canvas's `state.world.restoreError` and journal;
other operations continue on the fresh world. The capture replies with the byte count, world hash and tick; state
reports `restored: true` until the next tick or setup-argument rebuild. Current app bindings win over saved
arguments; `state.world.restoredFrom` shows the saved arguments while `restored` is true. Register types first spawned mid-game with `world.register::<Projectile>()` in `setup` so a fresh world can restore them. The iOS path is implemented but has not been driven in this session.

`state world:*` reads every entity's components in one reply (512 maximum,
then `truncated: true`); `state world:* under world:player` narrows to a subtree.
`s.type('world', {key: 'KeyW', for: 1500})` presses, advances the agent clock,
then releases on the same carrier even if the clock fails. CLI: `type world key KeyW for 1500`. The reply or error transcript retains partial steps.

`game/proof.mjs` supplies `proof(import.meta, async ({open, check, equal}) => { … })`.
`open()` builds this game's app only when its inputs change, opens a fresh session,
and records every operation. `check(label, condition)` reports failures without
stopping independent assertions; `equal(a, b)` compares JSON values. Every session
is closed and recorded children are checked before exit. Artifacts are in the game's
`artifacts/` directory; the first CLI argument selects web, macOS, or iOS.

## Working here

From the repository root:

```sh
bun game/new.mjs my-game                 # copy the complete, tested small game
bun game/dev.mjs my-game                 # the shared dev loop, on loopback
bun game/games/my-game/proof.mjs web      # or macos
```

Games are members of this workspace: one lockfile, profiles and dependency pins in
`game/`, no workspace manifest or lockfile in a game. The generator registers the
new packages in that shared lockfile without upgrading dependencies. The three
one-line host shells use shared dependencies and web/Apple build scripts; game
code lives in `logic/`, its UI in `app.contract`, and its proof beside them.
`cargo test` from `game/` runs the engine and every game's logic tests.
`bun test game/new.test.mjs` copies the real files in `game/new/`, builds and proves
the untouched game, then removes it. `bun scripts/caps.mjs` from the repository
root still holds every source file to 1,500 lines.

A world's observation starts `Unknown`, also after rebuilding, restoring, live
advancement, queued input, or live argument changes. Unknown is not quiescent.
Seekable advances sample the last two ticks of each jump (the start and end for
one tick). Unmarked entities count by existence, components, and parented global
pose. Resources count unless their `Resource` implementation declares
`const AMBIENT: bool = true`; physics and audio executor bookkeeping opt out.
Observations are derived caches, excluded from saves. Pending future input keeps
the clock awake and bounds its next jump. Replies report up to eight changed
components, moving springs/tweens, and explicit `world.busy(reason)` reasons.

`sim.run(ms)`, `key_down`, `key_up`, `tap`, `hold(code, ms)`, and `settle()` read
like proof operations. `settle()` returns whether it reached rest within sixteen
jumps, the host loop's bound. Spring/tween deadlines and queued input bound the
jumps; other work backs off from 100 ms to 2 s. Only a settle request increases
back-off; ordinary clock reads do not. A settle jump observes its last two ticks:
a one-shot change entirely inside a 2 s jump can be skipped. It is an observation
of rest, not a record of every intermediate transition.

`scene::follow(world)` steps saved `Follow` components where called. Call it at the
end of `setup` for exact first-frame placement, and in `tick` for following.
It accepts a handle (no name search) or a cached name, reads the target's current
parent chain, and reinitializes after teleport or a name's new incarnation.
Top-down views choose a safe up-axis; coincident aim preserves rotation.
`math::ease` arrives within 1e-4; `Tween::to(now, target, seconds)` supplies a finite
smoothstep beside `Spring`, with a known settle deadline.

Primitive dimensions are instance data; animation creates no geometry and all
spheres share one draw. The existing 48-byte material record is RGBA, metallic,
roughness, RGB emission, then three dimension floats (capsules: diameter, half
stem, diameter). At 200k slots it remains 9.6 MB; the two 40-byte transform records
remain 16 MB. Capsule cap signs occupy the reserved vertex UVs and position true
hemispheres without stretching them. Normals use inverse dimension scale.
Picking, layout and `Collider::of` use authored dimensions. A plane's slab is
1 cm thick, its top at Y=0; its box collider supports dynamic bodies.
`Mesh::Asset(name)` is refused by the surface until asset meshes are implemented.

Small is a feature. When something here feels clunky, slow or bloated, the move is
to delete it and try again, not to configure it.

## The world dev loop

`bun game/dev.mjs greybox` uses the same
core dev server as every app. Rust source edits exclusive to the GPU cdylib's
Cargo dep-info rebuild only that module under `gpu-dev`, then swap it under the
live canvas with its entire simulation carried. Shared/app inputs still rebuild
the app. Failed builds leave the old module running; incompatible carries leave a
fresh world and a dismissible error naming the refused field/type. Agent pages
never auto-swap.

A carry keeps the old setup's entities. New component fields default by name;
changing `setup` does not respawn a carried world. Reload the page or press
`f` then Enter in the dev server to start fresh. Contract edits carry uniquely
named surfaces across the plan restart; duplicate surface instances restart fresh
because their reassigned view ids cannot identify them honestly. A GPU swap stages
all replacement canvases before cutover; a create/bind/render failure leaves the
old worlds running. Dev bindgen glue has function scope so old Wasm instances can
be collected; production keeps its static ES module loader.
